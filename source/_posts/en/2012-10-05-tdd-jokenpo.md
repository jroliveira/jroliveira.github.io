Hello guys, inspired by a **dojo** that I had at my work, witch the problem that we choosed to solve was the game **Jokenpo**, I decided to write my soluction using **TDD**.

The problem was taken from <a href="http://dojopuzzles.com/problemas/exibe/jokenpo/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">DojoPuzzles.com - Jokenpo</a> witch by the way is very good and has severals problems to solve.

The soluction is published in my **GitHub**. Follow the link:

<a href="https://github.com/junioro/Jokenpo_CSharp" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Jokenpo - C#</a>

Until next time.
